## pipelining
In scikit-learn, pipelines are a powerful tool for combining multiple data processing steps and machine learning models into a single workflow. Pipelines ensure that the data preprocessing and 
model training steps are properly orchestrated, making the code more concise, readable, and efficient.
Here's an example of using a pipeline in scikit-learn:  
```py
from sklearn.pipeline import Pipeline
from sklearn.preprocessing import StandardScaler
from sklearn.decomposition import PCA
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression
from sklearn.model_selection import train_test_split
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris

# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
X = iris.data
y = iris.target

# Split the data into training and testing sets
X_train, X_test, y_train, y_test = train_test_split(X, y, test_size=0.2, random_state=42)

# Create a pipeline with two steps: data preprocessing and model training
pipeline = Pipeline([
    ('scaler', StandardScaler()),  # Step 1: Standardize the features
    ('pca', PCA(n_components=2)),  # Step 2: Perform PCA for dimensionality reduction
    ('classifier', LogisticRegression())  # Step 3: Train a logistic regression classifier
])

# Fit the pipeline to the training data
pipeline.fit(X_train, y_train)

# Make predictions on the testing data
y_pred = pipeline.predict(X_test)

# Evaluate the model performance
accuracy = pipeline.score(X_test, y_test)
print("Accuracy:", accuracy)
```

In the above example, we create a pipeline that consists of three steps:

Step 1: StandardScaler is used to standardize (mean centering and scaling to unit variance) the features in the dataset.

Step 2: PCA is applied to perform dimensionality reduction, reducing the number of features to two for visualization purposes. This step is optional and can be omitted if not needed.

Step 3: LogisticRegression is used as the classifier to train a logistic regression model on the preprocessed data.

The pipeline is then fitted to the training data using the fit method, which sequentially applies the defined steps to the data. Once the pipeline is trained, we can make predictions on the 
testing data using the predict method. The overall model performance is evaluated by calculating the accuracy using the score method.
